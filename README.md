# Your first front-end framework: React ðŸ§®

## Objectives

- Create a  React application
- Use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
- Organize a React app in components

## Specifications

You will build a small to-do application that lives in your browser and saves toâ€“dos even after restarting the browser.

### ðŸŒ± Must-haves
- Read this documentation on [The Basics](0.The-Basics/README.md)
- Create a React application and run it locally on your browser.
- Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
- Build a to-do app with React.js
- Save your to-dos, even after starting the browser again
- Deploy the project on a live server
  _Tip if you choose Netlify: to deploy a React app you first run the command `npm run build`, and once the command finishes you will have your app ready in the `build` folder: just drag and drop this folder in Netlify and you are done. Easy!_

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-haves (doable)
- Refactor parts you aren't happy with.
- Rebuild from scratch without any tutorial to improve your understanding ([Instructions](2.Extra-Documentation) will be of a big help here!).
- Improve on your project so that it's not only a learning repository, but also a show-off project when interviewing:
    - Add styling
    - Improve responsiveness
    - Check for little, smooth effects
    - Think UX: what extra features can make your todo app better?

### ðŸŒ³ Nice-to-haves (hard)

Done all of the above? Don't worry! We have some more you can do:

- Install a React calendar package and implement it in a new component into your app.
- Install and use React-router-dom as a router between components. _(Hint: Think about a structure like: router -> show component)_

- See if someone else needs help.
- Have a live edit option for existing to-dos (when you click on the text of a to-do, the app allows you to edit it in place).
- Make a version with another JS framework like VueJS or Svelte.
